- fitness based on total score, and "chaining" of fruits,
    where a fruit chain is defined as having fruits of successive sizes touching each other

- inputs:
    - current fruit size
    - number of fruits on screen
    - x and y positions of current fruits on screen, and whether each fruit
    is larger, smaller, or the same size as the current fruit (or perhaps just the radius itself?)
